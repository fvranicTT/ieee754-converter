# IEEE 754 Floating Point Converter

This project is an IEEE 754 Floating Point Converter that allows users to convert floating-point numbers into various formats, including Float32, Float16, Bfloat16, and TF32. The converter provides a visual representation of the binary and hexadecimal values, along with the error in conversion.

## Project Structure

```
ieee754-converter
├── src
│   ├── index.html        # Main HTML structure for the converter
│   ├── styles
│   │   └── styles.css    # CSS styles for the project
│   └── scripts
│       └── main.js       # JavaScript functionality for the converter
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```

## Usage Instructions

1. Open `src/index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter a floating-point number in the input field.
3. Click the "Convert" button to see the results.
4. The results will display the different floating-point representations along with their binary and hexadecimal formats.

## Implementation Details

- The project uses standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The CSS file (`styles/styles.css`) contains all styling rules to ensure a clean and responsive design.
- The JavaScript file (`scripts/main.js`) handles the conversion logic, including functions for binary and hexadecimal formatting, as well as error calculation.
